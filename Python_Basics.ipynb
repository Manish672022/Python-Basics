        "   -> In Python, an interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line. Unlike compiled languages (like C++ or Java), where the entire source code is first translated into machine code before execution, Python code is executed directly by the interpreter as it encounters each statement.\n",
        "   How it Works:-\n",
        "  (i) Reading: The Python interpreter reads a line of your Python code.\n",
        "  (ii) Parsing: It then analyzes that line to understand its syntax and meaning.\n",
        "  (iii) Execution: If the line is syntactically correct, the interpreter executes the corresponding operation.\n",
        "  (iv) Repeating: This process is repeated for each subsequent line of code until the entire program is executed or an error occurs.  \n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "  ->  In Python, pre-defined keywords are special words that have a specific meaning and purpose within the language's syntax. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (names for variables, functions, classes, etc.) because the interpreter reserves them for its internal operations.\n",

        "* try, except, finally: Used for exception handling to gracefully manage errors.\n",
        "* with: Used with context managers to ensure resources are properly managed.\n",
        "as: Used to create an alias when importing modules or handling exceptions.\n",
        "* break: Used to exit a loop prematurely.\n",
        "* continue: Used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next.\n",
        "* pass: A null operation; it does nothing. Often used as a placeholder where a statement is syntactically required but no action is needed yet.\n",
        "* assert: Used for debugging to check if a condition is true; if not, it raises an AssertionError.\n",
        "* del: Used to delete references to objects.\n",
        "* global: Used to declare that a variable inside a function refers to the global variable outside the function.\n",

        "# 4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "-> No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python.\n",
        "   Python reserves these keywords for its own internal structure and syntax. If you try to assign a value to a keyword or use a keyword as the name of a function, class, or any other identifier, the Python interpreter will raise a Syntax Error.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "-> Mutability in Python refers to the ability of an object to be changed after it is created. In simpler terms, if an object is mutable, you can modify its internal state (its values or contents) without creating a completely new object. If an object is immutable, its state cannot be changed after creation. Any operation that appears to modify an immutable object actually creates a new object with the updated value.\n",
        "\n",
        " Objects of mutable types can be modified in place. Some common mutable built-in types in Python include:\n",
        " * Lists (list): You can add, remove, or modify elements within a list.\n",
        " * Dictionaries (dict): You can add, remove, or modify key-value pairs in a\n",
        "   dictionary.\n",
        " * Sets (set): You can add or remove elements from a set.\n",

        "-> In Python, both == and is are comparison operators, but they serve fundamentally different purposes.\n",
        " \"==\" Equality Operator:-\n",
        " * Purpose: The \"==\" operator checks if the values of two operands are equal.\n",
        " * Comparison: It compares the content or the state of the objects being compared.\n",
        " * Customization: The behavior of == can be customized for user-defined classes. This allows you to define what it means for two instances of your class to be considered \"equal\" based on their attributes.\n",
        " * Common Use Cases: You'll use \"==\" most of the time when you want to know if two variables hold the same value, regardless of whether they are the exact same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        " \"is\" Identity Operator:-\n",
        " * Purpose: The is operator checks if two operands refer to the exact same object in memory.\n",
        " * Comparison: It compares the memory addresses of the objects. Two variables are is equal only if they point to the same memory location.\n",
        " * No Customization (Direct Memory Comparison): The behavior of is cannot be customized. It always performs a direct comparison of object identities.\n",
        " * Common Use Cases: is is typically used for:\n",
        "Checking for None: The canonical way to check if a variable is None is variable is None (or variable is not None). None is a singleton object, meaning there's only one instance of it in memory.\n",
        "Checking for the same object identity: In specific scenarios where you need to ensure that two variables are not just equal in value but are actually references to the same object. This can be important for understanding object sharing and potential side effects of modifications to mutable objects.\n",

        "-> Type casting in Python, also known as type conversion, is the process of changing an object from one data type to another. Python is a dynamically-typed language, which means you don't explicitly declare the data type of a variable. However, there are situations where you need to convert a value from one type to another to perform certain operations or meet specific requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python provides built-in functions to perform type casting. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:-\n",
        "(I) int():Converts a value to an integer.\n",
        " * From numbers: If you pass a float, it will truncate the decimal part.\n",
        " * From strings: If you pass a string, it must represent a valid integer (optionally with a leading sign).\n",
        " * From other types: The behavior depends on the type; some might raise a Type Error.\n",
        "(II) float():Converts a value to a floating-point number.\n",
        " * From integers: It will add a decimal part (e.g., 5 becomes 5.0).\n",
        " * From strings: The string must represent a valid floating-point number (optionally with a sign and decimal).\n",
        " * From other types: Behavior depends on the type.\n",

        "(V) list(), tuple(), set():Convert to list, tuple, and set respectively.\n",
        " * These can be used to convert iterable objects (like strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and ranges) into the desired collection type.\n",
        "# 9. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "-> The fundamental difference between implicit and explicit type casting (or type conversion) in Python lies in who performs the conversion: the Python interpreter or the programmer.\n",

        " * Goal: To make the operation compatible between the operands.\n",
        " * Programmer involvement: The programmer does not explicitly write any code to perform the conversion. The interpreter handles it behind the scenes.\n",

        " -> The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to control the flow of execution of a program based on whether certain conditions are true or false. They allow your program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code depending on the circumstances.\n",

        "if Condition False, elif Evaluation: If the if condition is False, Python moves on to the first elif statement and evaluates its condition.\n",
        "elif Condition True: If the elif condition is True, the code block under that elif statement is executed, and the remaining elif and else blocks are skipped.\n",
        "Multiple elif Statements: You can have multiple elif statements following an if statement. Each elif condition is evaluated in order only if the preceding if or elif conditions were False.\n",
        "elif Condition False: If an elif condition is False, Python proceeds to the next elif statement (if any) or the else block (if present).\n",
        "else as a Catch-All (Optional): The optional else block at the end of the if...elif...else structure is executed only if none of the preceding if or elif conditions were True.\n",
